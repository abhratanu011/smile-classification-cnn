# Smile Classification using CNN (PyTorch)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **binary image classification system** to detect whether a person is **smiling or not smiling**
using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **PyTorch**.

The model learns visual facial features from images and classifies them into:
- 😊 Smile  
- 😐 No Smile  

This project demonstrates practical usage of **CNNs, image preprocessing, and model evaluation** for computer vision tasks.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Convolutional layers with **ReLU activation**
- **MaxPooling** layers for spatial downsampling
- Fully connected (dense) layers
- **Sigmoid activation** for binary classification

Binary Cross Entropy loss is used during training.
